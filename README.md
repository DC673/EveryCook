A project for IT-490 @ NJIT called EveryCook.com where 44 components were created:
1. Front-end
2. Back-end
3. Database
4. Messaging

The four components were integrated together to create Everycook.com. The front-end used React,
Database used PostgreSQL, Messaging used RabbitMQ, and the Back-end used NodeJS. The features of 
the website include: recipe search, location of nearby Whole Foods, Acme, and Shoprite supermarkets,
friend lists and friend's favorite recipes showing up on your feed, meal planning, and recipe creation.
